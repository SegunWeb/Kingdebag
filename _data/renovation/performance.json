  "text": "Green renovation measures are widely recognised to be amongst the most cost-effective options to achieve emission reductions. However, the pace of renovation in all countries concerned is insufficient, staying well behind potential. Indeed, annual renovation rates globally should reach 4% by 2050 and 3% by 2030. <br><br>  Next to the pace, the depth of renovation needs to pick up with deep energy renovations that reduce energy consumption of existing buildings by 50% or more in developed economies and 30% or more in developing economies (GlobalABC/IEA/UNEP 2020 and UNEP/IEA2019), and achieve the highest energy efficiency potential to prevent lock-in. If a single deep retrofit is not financially viable, a step-by-step retrofitting should be mapped out.\n",
