Renovating the building stock is a key element of this objective.

Therefore, when it came to replacing its 1000m2 twin-skin asbestos roof, it was vital that the project was completed quickly and safely. <br><br>Kingspan’s technical team worked with Gravity Construction to specify an insulated panel roof system solution. The lightweight panels achieved a faster on-site build time than would have been possible with heavier built-up systems enabling the building to quickly be made weatherproof. \n",

The thickness of the insulation played a role. By choosing Kingspan insulation, you can build thinner wall and roof constructions, which ultimately provide more square meters.",
