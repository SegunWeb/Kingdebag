  "title_desc_one": "True circularity",
  "desc_one": "Recycling at end-of-life is only one aspect of a product’s lifecycle, true circularity is embedded throughout the entire lifecycle of the product. At Kingspan we have been working on a new framework to drive product circularity, that takes learnings from the Ellen McArthur circular economy principles.\n",


  "title_desc_two": "We’re asking ourselves questions all the way through the lifecycle of each product:\n",
  "desc_two": "Could less materials be used to make it? <br>Can more recycled or renewable materials be used to make it?<br>Is it designed from the outset to last longer?<br>Is it manufactured in a low-carbon, resource-efficient way?<br>Can it be reused after its first service life?<br>And as a last resort, can it be recycled using minimal natural resources such as energy or water?\n",


  "title_desc_three": "Our core philosophy",
  "desc_three": "Our core philosophy is to achieve product design that is inherently lean and circular. Today, our advanced insulation products are up to 50% more thermally-efficient than synthetic mineral fibre insulation, leading to more resource-efficient manufacture and potential savings in transport and building structure. \n"
