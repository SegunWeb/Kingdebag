  "title_desc_one": "Designed for disassembly\n",
  "desc_one": "There are many reasons why a building constructed today might be repurposed or disassembled at a future date. Consideration must also be given to the carbon impacts of a building, and the products with which it has been constructed, will have at the end of their life.",

  "title_desc_two": "Recycling can be carbon intensive\n",
  "desc_two": "Recycling can be a very carbon intensive process. Building materials must be transported to recycling depots, separated and, where possible, reprocessed into reusable materials with the remainder going to waste. Therefore reuse, where possible, is a preferred solution.",

  "desc_three": "Kingspan’s insulation systems can help to extend the life of existing buildings through external cladding. This can help to reduce the end of life carbon impact of those buildings. <br><br>Learn more in our upcoming case study about how Kingspan helped to reclad the building below for Solomon Commercials."
