  "desc": "Towards the middle of the century, as the world’s population approaches 10 billion, the global building stock is expected to double in size. Carbon emissions released before the built asset is used, what is referred to as ‘upfront carbon’, will be responsible for half of the entire carbon footprint of new construction between now and 2050, threatening to consume a large part of our remaining carbon budget. <br><br>Therefore the built environment sector has a vital role to play in responding to the climate emergency, and addressing upfront carbon is a critical and \nurgent focus.\n",
