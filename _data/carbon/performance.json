  "text": "Together, buildings and construction are responsible for 39% of all carbon emissions in the world, with operational emissions (from energy used to heat, cool, light and power appliances) accounting for 28%. The remaining 11% comes from embodied carbon emissions, or ‘upfront’ carbon that is associated with materials and construction processes throughout the whole building lifecycle.\n"
