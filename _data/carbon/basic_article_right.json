  "desc": "The Catalyst Building serves as the anchor for Spokane, Washington’s new Eco District. An area being billed as the smartest five blocks in the world. The building is expected to be certified as one of the largest zero-carbon, zero-energy buildings in North America.  Kingspan's KarrierPanel was a large part of this innovation. Kingspan worked in tandem with Katerra's cross-laminated timber (CLT) to construct a building with an ultra-low carbon footprint. <br><br> Our KarrierPanels provide superior R-value, when compared with mineral fibre insulation. With thicknesses from 2” to 6”, the panels deliver the high performance needed for such a forward-thinking project while still retaining a slim profile.  <br><br> KarrierPanel also allowed contractors to quickly close the building envelope and reduce the number of trades on site. The system uses KarrierRail to safely and securely transmit loads from the facade to structural supports behind the panels, reducing the number of wall components. With the help of Kingspan, the project was completed on time, notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic."
