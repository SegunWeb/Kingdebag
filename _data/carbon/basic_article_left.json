  "desc": "Sasaki collaborated closely with Kingspan, Hopkins, Arup, Consigli and Total Wall to design, prototype, test and successfully install a custom Kingspan QuadCore™ panel connection system.  <br><br> The high-performance connection system captures the top and bottom of each Kingspan QuadCore™ panel along the facade, which greatly reduced the number of envelope penetrations as well as the amount of secondary steel required for lateral support.  <br><br> Utilization of the Kingspan panel's inherent structural capacity, coupled with the reduction in steel structure, significantly lowered the associated embodied carbon. This could not have been accomplished without a truly integrated approach, in which Kingspan was a core team member.",
