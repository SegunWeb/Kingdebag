first_desc: Fons Americanus is intended as a monument to the horrors of the
  British slave trade. At 42 feet tall, the towering work is situated in Tate’s
  Turbine Hall, where it is due to remain on view through February 7. (After
  that, its materials will be recycled.) The work draws its inspiration from the
  iconic Victoria Memorial fountain at Buckingham Palace, and it pays homage to
  various historical figures and notable works from art history, often via
  sculptures intended to personify certain concepts.

  new music video by FKA twigs that premiered on Tuesday evening has at its
  center an artwork that has spurred debate recently: a giant fountain sculpture
  by Kara Walker that is now on view at Tate Modern in London. Titled Fons
  Americanus, the sculpture appears throughout the video, titled “Don’t Judge
  Me,” which accompanies a song FKA twigs made with Fred Again… and Headie One.
  Since it first went on view in 2019, Walker’s work is believed to have been
  seen by millions of viewers.
